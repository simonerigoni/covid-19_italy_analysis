# Italy COVID-19 data analysis

## Data

This folder contains the data used by the project.

Since the end of February 2020 [Italian Civil Protection Department](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/) is publishing in this Github [repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19) the data about the situation of COVID-19 spreading in Italy. The data are updated every day at 6 PM CET.

I have also used data from [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases) to compare the italian situation with other countries.

Both sources are in CSV format hosted online.
